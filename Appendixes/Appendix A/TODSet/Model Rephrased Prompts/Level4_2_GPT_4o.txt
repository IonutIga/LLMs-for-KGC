You are an expert in Knowledge Graphs. You have been given a domain ontology within double quotes, described using the Turtle syntax.
Your task is to analyze a natural language input text, which may or may not refer to instances of classes and relationships described in the ontology.
Using the ontology provided, your job is to extract triples about the instances mentioned in the input text as follows: 
1. Determine if any class from the ontology is mentioned in the input text. Look in the ontology for triples like :ClassName rdf:type owl:Class, where ClassName is the class name. The class name in the input text could be misspelled. If no known class is mentioned, output "None". 
2. Assign an ID to each identified instance using "Class" + "1", where "Class" is the detected class name. 
3. Always create a triple between the ID and the class type using the rdf:type relationship. 
4. Identify any mentioned relationships from the input text regarding the identified class. Search for triples like :RelationshipName rdfs:domain :ClassName or :Relationship rdfs:domain owl:Thing in the ontology, where owl:Thing represents the superclass of all classes. 
5. For each detected relationship, extract the mentioned object in the input text with respect to the identified instance. 
6. Present each triple as a JSON object with the format: {"subject" : ID, "relationship" : value, "object" : value}. If a triple refers to another instance, include all triples for that instance as well. If no triples are detected, output "None".
Do not add your JSON tags at the beginning (ex. "```json") and end of the output text (ex. "```"), leave only your answer.

Provided ontology: "
    @prefix : <http://john.com/project> .
    @prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
    @prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
    @prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

    <http://john.com/project> rdf:type owl:Ontology .

    :hasClass rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
        rdfs:domain :Project ;
        rdfs:range xsd:string .

    :hasCode rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
        rdfs:domain :Project ;
        rdfs:range xsd:string .

    :hasManager rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
        rdfs:domain :Project ;
        rdfs:range  :Employee .

    :hasName rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
        rdfs:domain owl:Thing ;
        rdfs:range xsd:string .

    :hasRole rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
        rdfs:domain :Employee ;
        rdfs:range xsd:string .

    :hasStatus rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
        rdfs:domain :Project ;
        rdfs:range :Status .


    :Employee rdf:type owl:Class ;
        rdfs:subClassOf owl:Thing.

    :Status rdf:type owl:Class;
        rdfs:subClassOf owl:Thing.

    :Project rdf:type owl:Class;
        rdfs:subClassOf owl:Thing." 

Example: 
Input text: Insert a project that has code 0A0, name it ColourRun, its class is Python and manager is Maia. 
1. In the ontology, three classes are found: Project, Employee, and Status. In the input text, the word "project" may refer to the class Project. 
2. The ID of the instance is the name of the class concatenated with "1", therefore the final ID is Project1. 
3. The type relationship creates the triple :Project1 rdf:type :Project. 
4. Given triples where the rdfs:domain is :Project or :Thing, specific relationships are hasName, hasCode, hasClass, hasManager, and hasStatus. Within the input text, relationship keywords like "name", "class", "code", and "manager" may lead to the following relationships: hasName, hasCode, hasClass, and hasManager. 
5. The possible object for each relationship may be words that semantically and/or syntactically relate to the relationship keywords. Therefore, we can extract: for hasName the word "ColourRun", for hasCode the word "0A0", for hasClass the word "Python", and for hasManager the word "Maia". 
6. For hasManager, the ontology specifies an Employee instance, therefore a new instance of type Employee with ID Employee1 is created, and the object "Maia" may be the name of it. Each triple has to be put in a JSON object respecting the provided template. All JSON objects must be put in a list. 
Output: [{"subject" : "Project1", "relationship" : "rdf:type" , "object" : "Project" },
         {"subject" : "Project1", "relationship" : "hasCode" , "object" : "0A0" },
         {"subject" : "Project1", "relationship" : "hasClass" , "object" : "Python" },
         {"subject" : "Project1", "relationship" : "hasManager", "object" : "Employee1" },
         {"subject" : "Employee1", "relationship" : "hasName", "object" : "Maia" },
         {"subject" : "Employee1", "relationship" : "rdf:type", "object" : "Employee" },
         {"subject" : "Project1", "relationship" : "hasName" , "object" : "ColourRun" }]
