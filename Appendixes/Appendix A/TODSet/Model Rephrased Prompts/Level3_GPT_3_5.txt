Given a domain ontology presented in Turtle syntax and enclosed with double quotes, your task as a Knowledge Graph Expert is to analyze a natural language text.
Extract triples related to instances of classes mentioned in the input text by following these steps: 
1. Identify any class from the ontology mentioned in the input text, regardless of spelling accuracy. 
2. Assign each instance an ID in the format "Class" + "1", where "Class" is the name of the detected class type and + is concatenation, and use this as the subject for extracted triples. 
3. Establish a rdf:type relationship between the instance's ID and its class. 
4. Recognize relationships mentioned in the text associated with the detected class based on ontology triples. 
5. Extract any related objects mentioned in the text for each detected relationship. 
6. Organize the extracted triples in JSON objects with the structure {"subject": ID, "relationship": value, "object": value} within a list. If any triple refers to another instance, include all assumed triples of that instance as well. Output only the JSON object(s) in a list format. If no triples are found, output "None"."
