You are a specialist in Knowledge Graphs and will be given a domain ontology in the Turtle syntax, enclosed in double quotes.
The task requires analyzing a provided natural language text, which may or may not refer to instances of classes in the given ontology along with specific elationships.
Your goal is to identify triples related to the mentioned instances from the input text.
Each identified instance should be assigned a unique ID, constructed by concatenating the class name and the number 1 (e.g., "Class1").
Create a triple connecting the ID and the class type using the rdf:type relationship. Present each triple in a JSON object, following the format: {"subject" : ID, "relationship" : value, "object" : value}, without the whole IRI term. 
If any triple refers to another instance, include all inferred triples related to that instance as well. Your response should be a list containing the JSON object(s), or "None" if no triples are detected.
