        "# Assessing LLMs Suitability for Knowledge Graph Completion\n",
        "\n",
        "!!! You need your own API Keys for Hugging Face and OpenAI. The notebook is intended to work on Google Colab, therefore save them there as Secrets. Save the HF token as \"HF_TOKEN\", and the OpenAI token as \"GPT_TOKEN\". The code will load them automatically, if instructions are followed.\n",
        "\n",
        "!!! As of 30/05/2025, HuggingFace imposed a small limit to the number of inference API calls. In our case, we could only send 26 calls to Mixtral-8x7b until the limit for a month was hit. Therefore, any model from HF needs to be locally loaded. We now provide this option in code, for Mixtral-8x7b, with a new function called *query2*. Keep in mind that some models necessitate huge amounts of GPU RAM, so choose an appropiate Colab configuration (in our case, GPU A100).\n",
        "\n",
        "Recent studies have demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform various Knowledge Graph-related tasks, including Knowledge Graph Construction, even in Zero- and Few-Shot settings. However, LLMs are prone to hallucinating information and producing non-deterministic outputs, which can result in flawed reasoning, even when the answers appear to meet user expectations. This unpredictability limits their integration into automated natural language processing pipelines, such as those used in chatbots or Task-Oriented Dialogue systems. To explore the potential and limitations of LLMs in Knowledge Graph tasks, we evaluate three prominent models, namely Mixtral-8x7b-Instruct-v0.1, GPT-3.5-Turbo-0125, and GPT-4o, on constructing static knowledge graphs. Our approach uses prompts based on the TELeR taxonomy in Zero- and One-Shot sce- narios, within the context of a Task-Oriented Dialogue system. We also propose a flexible evaluation framework that captures all usable information generated by the models, alongside traditional strict metrics, and introduce TODSet, a dataset tailored to gauge the performance of LLMs on knowledge graph-related tasks. Our findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts containing sufficient detail and examples, LLMs can effectively contribute to Knowledge Graph Construction tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**UPDATE (30/05/2025)**: The two datasets, Templates Easy and Templates Hard, are now referred to as one, namely TODSet. Still, each of them have a different set of samples, thus the code and experiments do not change.\n",
        "\n",
        "**UPDATE (30/05/2025)**: We now introduce experiments on a new dataset, called FootballSet. To evaluate our methodology in a more complex setting, we adapted the DBpedia-WebNLG sports ontology and dataset, originally developed by Mihindukulasooriya et al. (https://github.com/cenguix/Text2KGBench), to align with our format. This adaptation, inspired by their work, enabled us to assess model performance under increased ontological complexity.\n",

The ID of the instance is the name of the class concatenated with \"1\", therefore the final ID is Project1. \\n 3. The type relationship creates the triple :Project1 rdf:type :Project. \\n 4. Given triples where the rdfs:domain is :Project or :Thing, specific relationships are hasName, hasCode, hasClass, hasManager, and hasStatus. Within the input text, relationship keywords like \"name\", \"class\", \"code\", and \"manager\" may lead to the following relationships: hasName, hasCode, hasClass, and hasManager. \\n 5. The possible object for each relationship may be words that semantically and/or syntactically relate to the relationship keywords. Therefore, we can extract: for hasName the word \"ColourRun\", for hasCode the word \"0A0\", for hasClass the word \"Python\", and for hasManager the word \"Maia\". \\n 6. For hasManager, the ontology specifies an Employee instance, therefore a new instance of type Employee with ID Employee1 is created, and the object \"Maia\" may be the name of it. Each triple has to be put in a JSON object respecting the provided template. All JSON objects must be put in a list. \\n Output: [{{\"subject\" : \"Project1\", \"relationship\" : \"rdf:type\" , \"object\" : \"Project\" }}, {{\"subject\" : \"Project1\", \"relationship\" : \"hasCode\" , \"object\" : \"0A0\" }}, {{\"subject\" : \"Project1\", \"relationship\" : \"hasClass\" , \"object\" : \"Python\" }}, {{\"subject\" : \"Project1\", \"relationship\" : \"hasManager\", \"object\" : \"Employee1\" }}, {{\"subject\" : \"Employee1\", \"relationship\" : \"hasName\", \"object\" : \"Maia\" }}, {{\"subject\" : \"Employee1\", \"relationship\" : \"rdf:type\", \"object\" : \"Employee\" }}, {{\"subject\" : \"Project1\", \"relationship\" : \"hasName\" , \"object\" : \"ColourRun\" }}] \\n'\n",

In the ontology, 14 classes are found: \"SportsTeam\", \"Athlete\", \"Country\", \"City\", \"Person\", \"Place\", \"Demonym\", \"League\", \"Tenant\", \"Language\", \"Season\", \"State\", \"Ground\", \"Company\". In the input text, the word \"Athlete\" may refer to the class Athlete. This class is also a subclass of Person. Depending on the detected relationships domains, we have to decide whether Person or Athlete is the right choice. \\n 2. The ID of the instance is the name of the class concatenated with \"1\", therefore the final ID can be either Athlete1 or Person1. \\n 3. The type relationship creates either the triple :Athlete1 rdf:type :Athlete or :Person1 rdf:type :Person. \\n 4. Given triples where the rdfs:domain is :Athlete, :Thing or :Person (because the Athlete class is a subclass of Person), specific relationships are club, hasName, nickname and birthPlace. Within the input text, there are keywords like \"born in\", \"plays for\", and \"nicknamed\" that may lead to the following relationships: club (because playing for hints that the player is part of a football club), nickname and birthPlace. Also, we have his name which leads to the hasName relationship. \\n Revision to step 2. We can now say that the instance is of type Person, because the domains of most relationships it is part of are requesting Person instances. \\n 5. The possible object for each relationship may be words that semantically and/or syntactically relate to the relationship keywords. Therefore, we can extract: for hasName the words \"Marco Reus\", for club the words \"LA Galaxy\", for nickname the word \"Marcinho\", and for birthPlace the word \"Germany\". \\n 6. For club, the ontology specifies a SportsTeam instance, therefore a new instance of type SportsTeam with ID SportsTeam1 is created, and the object \"LA Galaxy\" may be the name of it. For birthPlace, the ontology specifies a Place instance. We can see that the detected object is \"Germany\" which is known to be a country. In the ontology, we can see that Country is a subclass of Place, therefore we can use Country as its class. Depending on the other related relationships, Place might have been the better choice, similar to how we have selected Person over Athlete. A new instance of type Country with ID Country1 is created, and the object \"Germany\" may be the name of it. Each triple has to be put in a JSON object respecting the provided template. All JSON objects must be put in a list. \\n Output: [{{\"subject\": \"Country1\", \"relationship\": \"rdf:type\", \"object\": \"Country\"}}, {{\"subject\": \"Country1\", \"relationship\": \"hasName\", \"object\": \"Germany\"}}, {{\"subject\": \"Person1\", \"relationship\": \"rdf:type\", \"object\": \"Person\"}}, {{\"subject\": \"Person1\", \"relationship\": \"hasName\", \"object\": \"Marco Reus\"}}, {{\"subject\": \"Person1\", \"relationship\": \"birthPlace\", \"object\": \"Country1\"}}, {{\"subject\": \"SportsTeam1\", \"relationship\": \"rdf:type\", \"object\": \"SportsTeam\"}}, {{\"subject\": \"SportsTeam1\", \"relationship\": \"hasName\", \"object\": \"LA Galaxy\"}}, {{\"subject\": \"Person1\", \"relationship\": \"club\", \"object\": \"SportsTeam1\"}}, {{\"subject\": \"Person1\", \"relationship\": \"nickname\", \"object\": \"Marcinho\"}}] \\n'\n",
